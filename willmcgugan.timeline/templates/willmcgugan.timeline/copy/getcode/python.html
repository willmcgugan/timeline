Install the inthing Python module with PIP as follows:

```bash
pip install inthing
```

You can then post events to your stream with the following:

```python
import inthing
{%- if stream.password %}
stream = inthing.Stream("${stream.uuid}", password="${stream.password}")
{%- else %}
stream = inthing.Stream("${stream.uuid}")
{%- endif %}
stream.text("Hello, World! #helloworld", title="New Event")
```

See the [inthing docs](https://inthing.readthedocs.io) for more information.
