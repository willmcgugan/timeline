The Inthing Application is installed along with the Python module, and can be installed with PIP:

```bash
pip install inthing
```

Then set the stream credentials as environment variables:

```bash
export INTHING_STREAM=${stream.uuid}
export INTHING_STREAM_PASSWORD="${stream.password or ''}"
```

You can now post an event from the command line:

```
inthing text "Hello, World! #helloworld" --title "New Event"
```
{% end %}
